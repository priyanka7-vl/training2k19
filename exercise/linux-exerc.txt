2.Delete file which has special characters. “ -“, “—“, “*”, “$”.

3. Write a shell script that take two input numbers from user at runtime and display arithmetic
operation on that numbers, find out max, & min number from them, find weather that numbers
negative or positive.

#!/bin/bash
num1=0
num2=0
echo -n "Enter the first number: "
read num1
echo -n "Enter the second number: "
read num2
echo "first number + second number = $((num1 + num2))"
echo "first number - second number = $((num1 - num2))"
echo "first number * second number = $((num1 * num2))"
echo "first number / second number = $((num1 / num2))"
echo "first number % second number = $((num1 % num2))"

if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is maximum number"
    echo "$num2 is minimum number"
else
    echo "$num2 is maximum number"
    echo "$num1 is minimum number"
fi

if [ $num1 -lt 0 ] && [ $num2 -lt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Negative"
    echo "$num2 is Negative"
elif [ $num1 -gt 0 ] && [ $num2 -gt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Positive"
    echo "$num2 is Positive"
elif [ $num1 -lt 0 ] && [ $num2 -gt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Negative"
    echo "$num2 is Positive"
elif [ $num1 -gt 0 ] && [ $num2 -lt 0 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is Positive"
    echo "$num2 is Negative"
else
    echo "Invalid Input"
fi

4.Write a shell script that take one input number from user and print 1 to n number using three
loops (For, while, until). (N = entered number)

#!/bin/bash
## For Loop
echo "for loop::"
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read number
for((i=1;i<=number;i++));
do
   echo $i
 done

##While Loop
echo "-------"
echo "while loop::"
n=1
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read number
while  (( $n <= number ))
do
        echo "$n"
        n=$(( n+1 ))     
done

##until
echo "-------"
echo "until loop::"
i=1
echo -n "Enter a number:"
read num
until (( $i >= num+1 ));
do
      echo "$i"
      i=$(( i+1 ))
done

5.Write a shell script to display the last updated file of the newest file in a directory.

ls -lrt | tail -1
l - long listing
r - reverse list 
t - sort by modification time[newest file]

6.Write a shell script to get the total count of the word “Linux” in all the “.txt” files and also across
files present in subdirectories.

grep -c -R 'linux'
c - count
R - subdirectories

another specific location.

cp dir_name

8.Display specific number of lines as follow:
1. Display first and last 10 lines of file contains
2. Display line no. 3 to 8 from file contains.
3. Display 7 lines and start from second last line in reverse manner.
1.head filename 
    tail filename
2.ex +3,8p -scq file1.txt
(or) sed -n 5,8p file
3.tac file1.txt > file5.txt
sed -n '2,9p' file5.txt

9. Perform following task:
1. Add two new users and two groups
2. Login as one user and then create new file
3. Send created file from one user to another user
4. Login as second user and copy that file from user2 to user1(in same system)
 sudo useradd username | su - username
           sudo ca ask the password su wont ask for the password
           sudo passwd username ---> to set password for the user
           sudo useradd sravya
           sudo  useradd radha
           two users created
           gedit /etc/passwd ----> to show the created user

 sudo groupadd gropuname ---> to create group 
           sudo group  family
           sudo -a -G family sravya ----> to add existing user into group
           grep group_name /etc/group ---> show which user is in this group

  su - username ---> to enter into he user we can perform what we want  
            cat > file ---> this file created in this particulat user

   sudo source_path destination path ---> send file from souece user to destination user
             sudo /home/sravya/file1.txt  /home/radha/file.txt
10.Task to find all files from folder where file contains string 'abc'
